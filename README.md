# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component 

## Overview
This challenge originated from Frontend Mentor. I wanted to challenge myself to use Reactjs to make a landing page exactly like their final product.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (mobile or desktop)
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process


### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Chakra UI
- iFrame
### What I learned

1. Chakra UI needs to be updated to version 2 to work with React v18.
2. Need to create a second box to insert description on the right of the picture


### Continued development

I would like to make this into database where I can iterate over and pass down as props.
